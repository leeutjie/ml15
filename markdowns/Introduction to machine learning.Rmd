This markdown is meant to complement the available slides, and will have the odd link here and there to some related material. 

# 1. Introduction

Resources:

* [R-bloggers Course](https://www.r-bloggers.com/in-depth-introduction-to-machine-learning-in-15-hours-of-expert-videos/)
* [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/)
* [The Elements of Statistical Learning](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/Papers/ESLII.pdf)

## Examples
Links to some stuff mentioned:

* [FiveThirtyEight](http://fivethirtyeight.com/)
* [Watson](https://www.ibm.com/watson/)

Examples of statistical learning problems:

* Identify the risk factors for prostate cancer.
* Classify a recorded phoneme based on a log-periodogram.
* Predict whether someone will have a heart attack on the basis of demographic, diet and clinical measurements.
* Customize an email spam detection system.
* Identify the numbers in a handwritten zip code.
* Classify a tissue sample into one of several cancer classes, based on a gene expression profile.
* Establish the relationship between salary and demographic variables in population survey data.
* Classify the pixels in a LANDSAT image, by usage.

## The Supervised Learning Problem

Where do we start? With definitions, obviously:

* *Y* - Outcome variable (dependent variable, response variable, target variabel, etc.)
* ***X*** - vector of *p* predictor measurements (inputs, regressors, covariates, features, independent variables)
* *Regression Problem* - Problem where *Y* is defeined as a **quantitative** variable
* *Classification Problem* - where *Y* is defined as a **qualitative** or **indicator** variable, taking values in a finite, unordered set
* *Training Data* - Observations *(x~1~,y~1~),...,(x~N~,y~N~)* that are measurements.
* The objecticve of supervised learning is to use training data for
    + Predicting unseen test cases
    + Understanding which inputs affect the outcome and how
    + Assess the quality of predictions and inferences

## So what is unsupervised learning, then?
* No outcome variable, just a set of predictors (features) measured on a set of samples.
* The objective is more fuzzy: 
    + Find groups of samples that behave similarly 
    + Find features that behave similarly 
    + Find linear combinations of features with the most variation
* It is difficult to know how well you're doing
* It is different from supervised learning, but can be useful as a pre-processing step for supervised learning

# 2. Statistical Learning

## Sales prediction example

*Sales* is considered the response variable, *Y*. *TV*, *Radio* and *Newspaper* each correspond to an *X_n* in the input vector **X**: 

$$\left(\begin{array}{l}
X_1=TV\\
X_2=Radio\\
X_3=Newspaper
\end{array}\right)$$

We state our model such that our outcome is a function of inputs with some stochastic component, $\epsilom$, that captures errors and other discrepancies:

$$Y = f(X) + \epsilon$$
If our function, $f$, is good enough, we can make predictions of $Y$ given specific values of the predictors (where $X=x$)
